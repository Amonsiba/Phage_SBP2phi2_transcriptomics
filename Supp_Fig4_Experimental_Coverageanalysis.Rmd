## Project Summary
This analysis is to determine the coverage of bacteria vs phage per sample. Samtools was conducted in HPC3 and the resulting txt files are downloaded: 1 set is mapped to the bacteria, 1 set is mapped to Phage SBP2phi2. The purpose of this is to show the burst of reads based on the one step growth curve to reflect the phage replication stragety.

```{r importing docs - bacteria}
bacteria_df <- read.csv("coverage_summary_bacteria.csv") %>%

  mutate(PercentagePhageReads = (Number_of_Reads_Phage/Total_Reads)*100) %>%
  mutate(PercentageBacteriaReads = (Number_of_Reads_Bacteria/Total_Reads)*100) 

#Cleans dataframe for time
